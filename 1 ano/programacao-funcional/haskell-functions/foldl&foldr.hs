The choice between foldl and foldr depends on the problem you are trying to solve and the structure of the list, for example, if the list is a list of numbers and you want to add them all, the order in which you add them doesn't matter, so you can use either foldl or foldr to achieve the same result. But if the list is a list of functions and you want to compose them, the order in which you compose them does matter, then you must use foldr in order to compose them in the correct order.

It's also worth noting that `foldl` is `less` `efficient` than foldr when working with `long` `lists`, this is because foldl will evaluate the function for each element of the list before the accumulator value is passed to the next element, this makes foldl stack overflow prone when dealing with large lists. In those cases, it's recommended to use foldl' instead, which is a strict version of foldl that evaluates the function for each element of the list before updating the accumulator value, this ensures that the accumulator value is never stored in memory and the function is never called again. This prevents stack overflow and makes foldl' more efficient when working with large lists.

In summary, foldl and foldr are similar higher-order functions in Haskell, but they apply the function to the elements of the list in different orders. foldl applies the function moving from left to right and foldr applies the function moving from right to left. Which one to use depends on the problem you are trying to solve and the structure of the list. And if you are working with large lists and performance is a concern, it's recommended to use foldl' instead of foldl.
